High speed experimental images analysis for droplets and bubbles hydrodynamics

This library currently contains tools to analyze experimental high speed images of oscillations of a single or a pair of droplets subject to electrostatic forcing. 
Simply copy the "eco" folder to python installation "\Lib\site-packages" folder. 
Example folder contains a text image of a axial cross section of the droplet created from the experimental images (video) using imageJ. This is analyzed for the oscillation dynamics of the drop tip and fitting an emperical model of electrostatically coupled oscillator. For more technical details, refer to the scientific manuscript on this work.
